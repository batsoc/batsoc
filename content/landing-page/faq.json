      "question": "No Touch, no risk",
      "answer": "Remember if you see a bat in trouble, hanging low or on the ground, don’t try to help it yourself. Ring your local bat care group (In FNQ, they are: insert numbers for WCFNQ and FNQWR and Tolga Bat Hospital)) and a vaccinated rescuer will contact you and rescue the bat.\n\n A tiny proportion of bats may carry a potentially deadly disease called lyssavirus, but it is only transmissible by bites or open scratches contaminated by an infected bat’s saliva. If you don’t touch bats, you are safe from disease. \n\n It is perfectly safe to be under bats in a camp or under trees where they are feeding. We do ask you to try not to disturb them though.\n\n If by some mischance, you are bitten or scratched by any bat,  wash the wound site with soap and water for five minutes, apply an antiseptic and visit your doctor or local hospital to obtain post exposure vaccination. This vaccination is 100% effective if you receive it before onset of symptoms. \n\n For more information see Australasian Bat Scoiety’s Bat fact: Bats and your health - link to BatFacts tab on ausbats.org.au)"
