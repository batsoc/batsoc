      "question": "No Touch, no risk",
      "answer": "Remember if you see a bat in trouble, hanging low or on the ground, don’t try to help it yourself. Ring your local bat care group (In FNQ, they are: insert numbers for WCFNQ and FNQWR and Tolga Bat Hospital)) and a vaccinated rescuer will contact you and rescue the bat.\n\n A tiny proportion of bats may carry a potentially deadly disease called lyssavirus, but it is only transmissible by bites or open scratches contaminated by an infected bat’s saliva. If you don’t touch bats, you are safe from disease. \n\n It is perfectly safe to be under bats in a camp or under trees where they are feeding. We do ask you to try not to disturb them though.\n\n If by some mischance, you are bitten or scratched by any bat,  wash the wound site with soap and water for five minutes, apply an antiseptic and visit your doctor or local hospital to obtain post exposure vaccination. This vaccination is 100% effective if you receive it before onset of symptoms. \n\n For more information see Australasian Bat Scoiety’s Bat fact: Bats and your health - link to BatFacts tab on ausbats.org.au)"

      "question": "What’s the best thing about Spectacled flying-foxes? ",
      "answer": "Spectacled flying-foxes are hardworking fly-in fly-out foresters of the night keeping our world heritage wet tropics rainforest healthy and diverse.  \n"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are flying-foxes important?",
      "answer": "Flying-foxes move pollen and seeds  longer distances than any other animal and feed in two or more remnant forests in the one night maintaining genetic biodiversity that helps our forests withstand climate change and other threats\n"

    {
      "question": "Why is the SFF endangered and how can I help? ",
      "answer": "The Australian population of spectacled flying-foxes declined over 75% between 2004 and 2017. This was followed by a loss of 23.000 individual animals (32% of the remaining population) in a heat wave in November 2018. The main causes are habitat loss through continuing vegetation clearing, climate change and cyclones. Another cyclone or heat stress event could wipe them out. \n\n\nYou can help by  planting a tree and letting us know where you see flying-foxes through our [Save Our Flying-foxes Watch program](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2C7BMN8)."

    {
      "question": "Where can I see flying-foxes?",
      "answer": "Flying-foxes use camps like backpackers use hostels- they are always on the move following the food resources but there are camps they use regularly at various times of the year. Most camps are seasonal but some places you can see them in the wild at some time during the year include Daintree River, Anderson Street Conservation Area in Cairns, Tolga Scrub, Port Duglas  and Gordonvale. When melaleucas are flowering you can find them on Cairns’ northern beaches. They also visit islands off-shore from Cairns. \n\nThe Bat Tourism trail is coming and it will have details of all camps and the most likely time to see them- in the meantime check out the [Australasian Bat Night program](https://www.ausbats.org.au/bat-nights.html) and Find a Bat Night near You or contact us with your location and we’ll let you know where your nearest flying-foxes are. \n\nYou can get close up to a flying-fox at Tolga Bat Hospital (link), BatReach Kuranda (link) or  see the newly arrived flying-fox group at [Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures](https://www.crocodileadventures.com/)."

      "question": "No touch No risk",
      "answer": "Like all animals and us, bats may carry some diseases. There are two of concern in Australia, Australian Bat lyssavirus, which may be carried by any bat, and Hendra virus which can be carried by flying-foxes. Both diseases are 100% manageable.\n\nYou can only get lyssavirus by a bite or scratch that bleeds from a bat with lyssavirus. Less than 1% of wild bats carry lyssavirus. Bats that are on the ground or low down may be sick, and lyssavirus might be the cause. And like any wild animal, bats may bite or scratch to defend themselves if you try to pick them up.. If you don't touch bats, you cannot get lyssavirus. Instead call your local wildlife care group and follow their instructions. They will send a vaccinated and experienced rescuer for the bat. \n\nPeople do not get Hendra directly from contact with a flying-fox. Horses are particularly susceptible to Hendra and people and pets can get it from a sick horse. It can be managed by covering water troughs, and not allowing horses to graze under flowering and fruiting trees that flying-foxes feed in. The best protection is vaccinating your horse. Since this vaccine was developed, only unvaccinated horses have caught Hendra. \n\nIf your pet catches a bat, please call a vet and a wildlife rescuer. \n\nBats flying overhead or feeding in trees do not constitute a risk to you or your pets. \n\nIf you don't touch bats, there is no risk."
