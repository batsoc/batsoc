These include but are not limited to: vaccinations for bat rescuers and carers, rescue materials and equipment but one of our greatest expenses, most often born by the carers themselves, is the cost of food and nutrient supplements for the bats whilst in care and undergoing rehabilitation prior to re-release back into the wild.\nWatch this space as we develop our sales page and in the meantime - donate directly to BatSoc or through Patreon.\n\nShort on cash- you can help us raise money in two ways:\n\n1. If you are in Queensland, you can drop your 10cents refund containers into a ContainersForChange depot and select to give to a scheme and enter Bats and Trees Society of Cairns scheme ID: C10663841\n\n2. by voting for Bats and Trees Society on MyGivingCircle. Simple vote for us each week and help us get to the Top Ten for the round. At the end of each fundraising round, this organisation will give money to  the organisations with the most votes.  You can also donate, and the donations come directly to BatSoc to help us feed bats in care.",
